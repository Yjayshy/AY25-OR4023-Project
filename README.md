# Ride-Hailing Vehicle Dispatch Optimization 
We are a small team in Applied Mathematics, BNBU. To make our Optimization project more complete, we uploaded our sorted [Data](https://github.com/Yjayshy/AY25_OR4023_Ride-Hailing-Vehicle-Dispatch-Optimization/tree/main/Data) and [Code](https://github.com/Yjayshy/AY25_OR4023_Ride-Hailing-Vehicle-Dispatch-Optimization/tree/main/Code) that used in project. 
Every year, the [NYC](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) Taxi and Limousine Commission releases a dataset about Uber's ridership. We sorted one day [Data](https://github.com/Yjayshy/AY25_OR4023_Ride-Hailing-Vehicle-Dispatch-Optimization/tree/main/Data) and applied in our model.
We are extremely grateful for the prof.Yuliang Wang's guidance.
During our research, we encountered numerous difficulties, but we overcame each one. Eventually, the joy of applying what we learned outweighed the process of learning itself. We realized that research is challenging but also enjoyable. We pay tribute to every researcher, especially those in the field of mathematics.
