# Ride-Hailing Vehicle Dispatch Optimization
We have uploaded our collected and code in this repository.
Every year, the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission [NYC](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) released a dataset about Uber's ridership.Based on these data, we have sorted them according to our own model and they are stored in the [Data](https://github.com/Yjayshy/AY25_OR4023_Ride-Hailing-Vehicle-Dispatch-Optimization/Data.git) folder.
There totally three python code for project which lies in [Code](https://github.com/Yjayshy/AY25_OR4023_Ride-Hailing-Vehicle-Dispatch-Optimization/tree/main/Data)

During our research, we encountered numerous difficulties, but we overcame each one. Eventually, the joy of applying what we learned outweighed the process of learning itself. We realized that research is challenging but also enjoyable. We pay tribute to every researcher, especially those in the field of mathematics
