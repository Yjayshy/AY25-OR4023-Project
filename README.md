# Ride-Hailing Vehicle Dispatch Optimization in BNBU
We have uploaded our collected and code in this repository.
Every year, the [NYC](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) Taxi and Limousine Commission releases a dataset about Uber's ridership. We sorted one day [Data](https://github.com/Yjayshy/AY25_OR4023_Ride-Hailing-Vehicle-Dispatch-Optimization/tree/main/Data) and applied in our own model. There are totally three [Code](https://github.com/Yjayshy/AY25_OR4023_Ride-Hailing-Vehicle-Dispatch-Optimization/tree/main/Code) used in project .

During our research, we encountered numerous difficulties, but we overcame each one. Eventually, the joy of applying what we learned outweighed the process of learning itself. We realized that research is challenging but also enjoyable. We pay tribute to every researcher, especially those in the field of mathematics.
